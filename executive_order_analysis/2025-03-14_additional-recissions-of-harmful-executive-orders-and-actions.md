# Comprehensive Analysis of Executive Order Issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 14, 2025:

---

### **1️⃣ Summary & Intent**

This Executive Order issued by President Donald J. Trump revokes various executive actions from the Biden Administration. The stated purpose is to "restore common sense to the Federal Government" and "unleash the potential of American citizens," though it notably refrains from offering explicit policy goals or detailed justifications for the revocations.

**Key Provisions & Policy Changes:**

The order revokes several provisions that significantly impact public health, workers' pay, climate sustainability, energy security, international human rights, labor standards, and Indigenous sovereignty, including but not limited to:

- Revocation of actions aimed at a data-driven COVID-19 response and the strengthening of bio-manufacturing (E.O. 13994, E.O. 14081).
- Reversal of effort to increase the minimum wages for federal contractors (E.O. 14026).
- Cancellation of defense production measures ensuring the stable supply of infant formula, clean energy components (solar panels, electrolyzers, heat pumps), and energy-efficient insulation.
- Withdrawal from commitments to promoting LGBT rights internationally and global worker empowerment.
- Termination of policies supporting Tribal nations, apprenticeship expansion, and federal investments in workers.

**Modifies or Repeals:** This E.O. explicitly repeals multiple Biden-era orders and memoranda that advanced progressive policies.

🔹 **Impact on Health care, Education, Childcare, or Housing:**  
- Health care & child wellbeing negatively impacted through revocation of health data efforts and elimination of infant formula supply protections.  
- Negative economic impacts on workers through rescinding increased federal contractor wages and worker empowerment standards. These indirectly affect affordability and accessibility in housing and childcare.

### **2️⃣ Fact-Checking & Factual Basis**

**Claims Made:** 
- Suggests the Biden-era orders are contrary to "common sense" without explicitly proving or substantiating this claim.
- Implies these orders impeded American potential.

**Assessment:**  
- Claims are **misleading and partly false** as these Biden-era provisions were empirically linked to tangible improvements (e.g., higher wages, stable supply chains, public health safeguards). For instance:
  - COVID-19 data-driven policies demonstrably saved American lives (CDC, 2022; Lancet Commission, 2023).
  - Raising wages for federal contractors reduced poverty among employed families (Economic Policy Institute Report, 2023).
  - Defense Production Act (DPA) determinations (e.g., infant formula crisis 2022) directly alleviated urgent shortages (FDA Monthly Reports, 2022).

This order lacks supporting data or analysis; existing evidence strongly supports continuation rather than rescission.

### **3️⃣ Constitutionality & Legal Precedents**

The President has authority to revoke prior executive orders; traditionally, executive orders are subject to reversal or rescission by subsequent administrations.

However, there are possible legal challenges and conflicts:

- Revocation of DPA uses, especially regarding public health (infant formula) and energy security, may trigger legal challenges for undermining federal statutory obligations under DPA provisions and established legislative intent.
- International human rights reversal: Potentially challenges established U.S. commitments under multilateral treaties and conventions related to human rights obligations.

🔍 **Relevant Precedents:**  
- **Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952)**: Set limits on executive power where contrary to legislative intention.  
- **Massachusetts v. EPA (2007)** and more recent district court decisions (2022-2024) reiterate executive obligations toward climate policy and public health.

These legal grounds offer strong frameworks for challenging certain parts of this order.

---

### **4️⃣ National Stability & Institutional Trust**

- **🔹 Public Confidence:** Undermines confidence in expertise-driven governance, science-based public health guidance, and labor protections, negatively affecting institutional trust.
- **🔹Civil Unrest Risks:** High potential to incite significant unrest, backlash, and protests due to rollback of issues deeply important to broad communities, including labor groups, Indigenous peoples, LGBTQ activists, healthcare providers, and environmental advocates.
- **🔹Democratic Integrity:** Weakens democratic transparency by failing to provide rationale for removals.
- **🔹Rule of Law:** Sets troubling precedent for expansive executive reversals without substantive policy justifications, signaling potential executive overreach unchecked by congressional oversight.

---

### **5️⃣ Harm & Impact Assessment**

- **🔹 Direct Harm:** Likely infringes upon workers' economic rights, health protections, and LGBTQ rights internationally.
- **🔹 Legal Harm:** Sets problematic precedent for disregard of statutory intent behind executive actions (like DPA).
- **🔹 Economic Harm:** Economic instability by disrupting supply chains (infant formula, clean energy), lower wages for federal contractors, negatively affecting employment levels and economic equity.
- **🔹 Environmental Harm:** Clear rollback of protections supporting clean energy technology, impairs climate goals significantly.
- **🔹 Global Stability:** Decreases credibility of US commitments to human rights abroad. Could negatively impact international collaboration, diplomatic standing, and global partnerships.
- **🔹 Social Equity & Progressive Values:** Actively restricts economic opportunities (wages), healthcare access (infant formula/public health), energy security, Indigenous sovereignty, education via apprenticeships, and global human rights leadership.

### **6️⃣ Policy in Real Life: Individual Impact**

When Emily Thompson attended community college on federal Pell Grants, she was able to study nursing and find stable employment as a caregiver to veterans. Under Biden-era executive orders, Emily's childcare provider, who was federally contracted, had seen wages rise to $15 per hour. Her family had stability; they could manage their monthly bills and had begun saving modestly towards a home. The dependable contracts and fair wages allowed Emily—an essential caregiver—to focus at work, knowing her children's daycare had staff fairly valued and compensated.  

Now, President Trump's reversal of wage guarantees for federal contractors directly threatens this stability. Emily's childcare center faces wage cuts and likely turnover among familiar caretakers who can no longer sustain their families on lowered wages. Emily herself now faces increased anxiety about her children's care, uncertainty over her budget, and fears of losing potential homeownership opportunities due to financial instability. This executive order not only disrupts Emily’s family life but also imperils the quality of caregiving provided to veterans who rely daily on the dedication and skills of healthcare workers like Emily. The ripples spread across each family who depended on these protections, destabilizing community cohesion, economic vitality, and human dignity.

### **8️⃣ Action & Mobilization**

#### ✉️ **Letter to Congress**

Dear Representative [Representative’s Name],

I urge you in the strongest possible terms to oppose the recent Executive Order from President Trump dated March 14, 2025, repealing vital protections across healthcare, economic stability, human rights, and energy security. In particular, revoking the increased wage policy for federal contractors will severely harm working families, exacerbate poverty, and dismantle critical employment standards established in recent years.

The rollback of measures ensuring adequate infant formula supply, healthcare safeguards, clean energy manufacturing, and support to marginalized communities constitutes an urgent threat to our society’s health, economic justice, and environmental future. I implore you to lead an immediate congressional effort to uphold protections for working Americans and vulnerable populations impacted by the retrenchment of these essential policies.

Sincerely,  
[Sender’s Name]
