---

Below is our structured evaluation of the executive order titled “Making America Beautiful Again by Improving Our National Parks” issued on July 3, 2025.

──────────────────────────────
1. Summary & Intent  
• Summary: This order directs the Department of the Interior—and, where appropriate, the Departments of Agriculture and State—to expand and improve America’s national parks. It does so by increasing entrance and recreation pass fees for foreign tourists while strengthening the affordability and overall visitor experience for U.S. residents, and by investing new fee revenues in park infrastructure and maintenance.  
• Key Provisions & Policy Changes:  
  – Mandating higher fees for nonresident visitors, with revenue earmarked for park improvements.  
  – Providing preferential treatment and cost improvements for U.S. residents when visiting parks.  
  – Instructing a review (and potential rescission) of past rules—specifically targeting measures put in place by the prior administration that promoted diversity and inclusion in public lands.  
  – Repealing the January 12, 2017, diversity and inclusion memorandum for public lands.  
• Impact on Progressive Priorities:  
  – Although not directly touching on health care, education, childcare, or housing, revoking the inclusion memorandum may be seen as a step away from policies that foster equitable access to public resources—a value progressives often champion.  
• Systemic Racism:  
  – While the order does not explicitly create racially discriminatory policies, its revocation of an earlier pro-diversity directive could be interpreted as reducing efforts to ensure inclusivity in public lands, potentially undermining affirmative measures that sought to counterbalance historical inequities.  
• Project 2025 Agenda:  
  – The focus on prioritizing U.S. residents over international visitors, the emphasis on market-based fee adjustments, and the removal of a diversity-focused policy are consistent with the nationalist, America-first tone reflected in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 agenda, suggesting alignment with that broader political philosophy.  
• Impact on Women & Bodily Autonomy:  
  – There is no direct reference or measure within this order that affects women’s rights or bodily autonomy.

──────────────────────────────
2. Fact-Checking & Factual Basis  
• Key Claims:  
  – Increasing nonresident fees will generate additional revenue that can be reinvested in park infrastructure and enhanced visitor services.  
  – Past rules (including those emphasizing diversity and inclusion) unnecessarily restrict recreational access to national parks.  
• Verification:  
  – It is generally true that fee adjustments can alter revenue streams; however, the actual outcome will depend on visitor responses and economic conditions—this claim is mostly true if managed alongside appropriate planning.  
  – The assertion that former inclusion-focused rules “unnecessarily restrict” access is partly true as a policy opinion; official studies on the operational impact of such measures have shown mixed results, making this claim depend on one’s policy perspective.  
• Supporting Data:  
  – Government reports on park funding (e.g., from the National Park Service and the Great American Outdoors Act) confirm longstanding maintenance backlogs that additional revenues could help address.

──────────────────────────────
3. Constitutionality & Legal Precedents  
• Constitutional Principles & Precedent:  
  – The order appears to fall within the President’s executive authority under the Constitution and existing federal statutes governing the management of national parks and public lands.  
  – Rescinding prior memoranda is legally permissible as long as it abides by statutory frameworks.  
• Potential Legal Challenges:  
  – Stakeholders arguing that preferential treatment for U.S. residents might run afoul of international trade norms or non-discrimination principles could challenge aspects of the order.  
  – The rescission of the diversity and inclusion memorandum may invite litigation from groups that benefited from the prior directive.  
• Relevant Cases & Precedents:  
  – Past Supreme Court rulings (e.g., Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.) have shown deference to executive interpretations of statutory mandates, although administrative procedure challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act could be raised if affected parties claim improper rulemaking processes.

──────────────────────────────
4. National Stability & Institutional Trust  
• Public Confidence:  
  – The order’s emphasis on “making America beautiful again” and prioritizing U.S. residents may resonate with some but might breed distrust among international partners and communities that value inclusive public access, potentially undermining trust in federal commitment to diversity.  
• Civil Unrest Risks:  
  – While unlikely to directly incite mass protests, the reversal of diversity and inclusion policies could contribute to political polarization among groups advocating for equitable access to public resources.  
• Democratic Integrity & Rule of Law:  
  – The order largely operates within the bounds of executive authority; however, its rescission of previous policies may be seen as an example of executive overreach that could weaken legislative or judicial checks if applied more broadly in other domains.

──────────────────────────────
5. Harm & Impact Assessment  
• Direct Harm:  
  – There is minimal direct infringement on individual rights; the order primarily reorients fee structures and public land management practices.  
• Legal Harm:  
  – By potentially undermining inclusivity measures, it may weaken efforts to ensure equal access to cherished public spaces, indirectly impacting communities that have historically faced barriers.  
• Economic Harm:  
  – The policy is intended to generate funds for critical park infrastructure; however, higher fees for nonresidents might reduce international tourism revenue if perceived as exclusionary.  
• Environmental & Global Stability:  
  – Improved funding for infrastructure may foster better environmental stewardship, yet a nationalist tone could affect international perceptions and cultural diplomacy.  
• Social Equity & Progressive Values:  
  – The order’s rollback of diversity and inclusion directives restricts the spirit of inclusive public access and does not enhance access for underserved communities, marking a setback for progressive values even if it leaves other areas (like healthcare or education) unaffected.

──────────────────────────────
6. Policy in Real Life: Individual Impact  
Imagine the Johnson family—a multigenerational household whose tradition has been to visit America’s national parks each summer. For years, the inclusive policies of the previous administration helped families from all backgrounds experience the beauty of these lands. Under this new executive order, while U.S. residents like the Johnsons may benefit from improved facilities and more affordable entry, the rescinding of the diversity and inclusion mandate leaves many mixed-heritage or immigrant families feeling unwelcome and anxious about their place in these national treasures. This shift not only alters how the parks are managed but also signals a retreat from values that once celebrated America’s rich cultural mosaic.  

For individuals who have long relied on progressive policies to ensure equitable access, such as the inclusive programming once promoted by the revoked memorandum, this order is a stark reminder that gains in some areas—like infrastructure investment—can come at the expense of hard-won social progress. The recalibration in favor of a more nationalist approach risks fracturing the sense of community and shared heritage that many Americans, particularly those from historically marginalized backgrounds, have come to rely on as a symbol of equal opportunity.

──────────────────────────────
7. Final Scoring (-5 to +5 in each category)  
• Fact-Checking Score: +3  
  – The revenue and infrastructure claims are mostly supported by precedent, though some assertions are policy opinions open to debate.  
• Constitutionality Score: +2  
  – The order appears within the President’s authority; yet, its rescission of prior directives may prompt legal challenges under administrative law.  
• National Stability Score: +1  
  – While the improvements to park infrastructure may bolster national pride, the exclusionary aspects and rollback of inclusivity risk heightened polarization.  
• Harm Score: -1  
  – Although the order aims to reinvest in public lands, the undermining of diversity initiatives may produce social harm through decreased inclusivity and potential diplomatic repercussions.  
• Progressive Values Score: -3  
  – The preferential pricing for U.S. residents and the revocation of measures designed to enhance diversity in our public lands run counter to progressive principles of fairness and inclusivity.  

Aggregate Score Calculation: +3 + +2 + +1 + (-1) + (-3) = +2  
Interpretation: A total score of +2 indicates that, while there are some benefits (enhanced park infrastructure and increased revenue) and the order appears legally defensible within executive authority, the social equity setbacks and rollback of diversity measures render its overall impact somewhat harmful to progressive priorities.

8. Action & Mobilization  

✉️ Letter to Congress  
[Begin Letter]  
Dear [Representative's Name],

I am writing to express deep concern over the recent executive order aimed at “Making America Beautiful Again by Improving Our National Parks.” Although investing in and maintaining our national treasures is undoubtedly important, this order takes a troubling turn by increasing entry fees for foreign visitors while simultaneously rescinding policies designed to promote diversity and inclusion in public lands. These changes signal a move away from the progressive values of equal access and inclusivity—values that have long enriched our nation’s cultural and civic life.

I urge you to oppose this executive order. It is crucial that our public lands remain symbols of unity and accessibility for all Americans, including immigrant communities and families from historically marginalized backgrounds. Please stand with those who believe in a future where public resources, much like healthcare, education, childcare, and housing, are accessible to everyone regardless of background. I respectfully ask that you advocate for policies that ensure our parks serve as a bridge rather than a barrier in our society.

Sincerely,  
[Sender's Name]

9. Final Verdict & Takeaways  
The executive order carries a mixed legacy. On the one hand, its focus on reinvesting increased revenue from nonresident fees into park infrastructure could benefit American families and the nation’s natural heritage. On the other, the rollback of diversity and inclusion directives—and the built-in preferential treatment for U.S. residents—raises serious concerns about fairness and inclusivity. Legally, the order is likely to stand on routine executive authority, but its socially exclusionary measures risk fueling political polarization and undermining progressive goals.  

Key risks include potential litigation challenging the preferential treatment measures and resentment among communities that benefited from previous inclusive policies. While the attempt to enhance public lands is commendable, we must ensure that public resources like national parks do not become tools for exclusion but remain accessible to all Americans. Citizens and policymakers must work together to balance fiscal and infrastructural improvements with a commitment to the equitable values that strengthen our democracy.

──────────────────────────────
Overall Analysis Summary  
• Verdict: The order is legally within presidential authority and offers tangible benefits for park maintenance; however, it is controversial due to its exclusionary tilt and rollback of inclusion policies.  
• Progressive Impact: It represents a step back in inclusivity and equal access, compromising Progressive Values in favor of a more nationalist approach.  

Mobilization tools—such as the provided letter and social media posts—are essential for ensuring that representatives understand the need to balance improved infrastructure with policies that protect the diverse, equitable spirit of our nation.
