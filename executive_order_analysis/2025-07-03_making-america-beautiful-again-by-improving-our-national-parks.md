---

Below is our structured evaluation of the executive order:

─────────────────────────────  
1. Summary & Intent  
• Summary: This executive order directs the Departments of the Interior (and Agriculture and State, as needed) to modify national park policy. Its central thrust is to increase entry and recreation pass fees for foreign (nonresident) visitors while using the extra revenue to improve park infrastructure and visitor services. At the same time, it mandates that United States residents receive improved affordability and preferential treatment when accessing federal recreational lands. The order also revokes a 2017 memorandum aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in national parks.  

• Key Provisions & Policy Changes:  
 – Increase fees on nonresident visitors for national parks and related recreational lands.  
 – Use increased fee revenue to restore and invest in park infrastructure and maintenance, connecting efforts to the legacy of the Great American Outdoors Act.  
 – Enhance services, affordability, and visitor capacity for U.S. residents.  
 – Direct a review (and potential rescission) of existing rules and restrictions—especially those implemented during the prior administration—to ensure greater recreational access for American residents.  
 – Explicitly revoke the January 12, 2017, diversity and inclusion memorandum.  

• Impacts on Health Care, Education, Childcare, or Housing?  
The order is focused solely on the management, revenue, and public accessibility of national parks. It does not directly affect health care, education, childcare, or housing.  

• Systemic Racism?  
By rescinding a prior diversity and inclusion memorandum, the order removes an effort that many viewed as a corrective step toward inclusive access to public lands. Critics could argue that this withdrawal may undermine deliberate measures to counter systemic exclusion, potentially reinforcing longstanding inequities in access to public benefits; however, the order itself does not explicitly promulgate discriminatory policies.

• Alignment with Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 Agenda?  
While the order reflects nationalist and “America First” priorities—such as charging nonresidents more and privileging U.S. citizens—it is not explicitly tied to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 agenda. However, its emphasis on tightening eligibility for certain public benefits and reversing progressive inclusion policies aligns ideologically with conservative frameworks that call for prioritizing American citizens.

• Impact on Women and Bodily Autonomy?  
There is no provision in this order that would hurt women or impinge upon bodily autonomy. Its focus is limited to the administration of national parks and recreational policy.  

─────────────────────────────  
2. Fact-Checking & Factual Basis  
• Key Claims & Evaluations:  
 – Claim: Increasing entry fees for foreign visitors will generate revenue to improve park infrastructure.  
  Evaluation: Mostly True. Increasing fees for nonresidents is a plausible revenue-raising measure; similar policies have been enacted in other sectors, though the resulting revenue depends on visitor numbers and market responses.  
 – Claim: Rescinding past diversity and inclusion initiatives will “enhance” recreational access for U.S. residents.  
  Evaluation: Partly True. While preferential policies could indeed enhance access for U.S. residents, the removal of inclusion programs also risks alienating minority communities and undermining efforts to ensure equitable access.  
• Supporting Sources:  
 – The Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law 116-152) provides statutory authority for infrastructure investments within the National Park Service.  
 – Historical precedent exists for differential pricing based on residency in many tourism contexts, but the social impact of rescinding inclusion policies is debated in academic and policy studies.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Constitutionality & Legal Precedents  
• Constitutional Principles & Legal Precedents:  
 – The executive order falls within the President’s authority to manage federal lands and natural resources. Traditionally, policies regarding park fees and infrastructure investment have been upheld as within the executive branch’s purview.  
 – Potential Legal Challenges:  
  – The preferential treatment toward U.S. residents over foreign visitors could spark challenges based on equal protection or international treaty obligations, though courts have generally afforded the executive discretion in matters of park management.  
  – The order’s directive to review and rescind prior rules (especially those tied to diversity and inclusion) could be contested as an arbitrary removal of long-established policy goals, raising due process questions under administrative law.  
• Relevant Opinions:  
 – Past Supreme Court rulings support executive discretion over natural resource management (subject to statutory constraints), while also underscoring adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act in significant regulatory reversals.

─────────────────────────────  
4. National Stability & Institutional Trust  
• Public Confidence:  
 – For supporters, prioritizing American residents in access to national treasures may reinforce a sense of national pride and trust in government responsiveness.  
 – For critics, rescinding the diversity and inclusion memorandum can be seen as a step backward in social equity, potentially undermining trust among marginalized groups.  
• Civil Unrest Risks & Democratic Integrity:  
 – The politicization of public lands management—especially when tied to nationalistic priorities—carries the risk of increased polarization, though it does not appear likely to lead to mass protests or destabilize democratic institutions.  
• Rule of Law Concerns:  
 – While the order runs squarely in the realm of executive discretion, its broad instruction to undo prior administrative policies could be seen as an instance of executive overreach if it bypasses established administrative procedures.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Harm & Impact Assessment  
• Direct Harm:  
 – The primary impact is on how visitors are charged and prioritized in national parks. Nonresident visitors will face higher costs, which may limit international tourism experiences.  
• Legal Harm:  
 – The removal of inclusion measures risks erasing progress toward equal access in public spaces, potentially undermining trust among communities that relied on those initiatives.  
• Economic Harm:  
 – Local economies dependent on tourism may experience short-term disruptions if international visitor numbers decline, though increased domestic revenue could mitigate this over time.  
• Environmental Harm:  
 – Increased revenues earmarked for park infrastructure may lead to improved conservation and sustainability practices, assuming funds are effectively allocated.  
• Global Stability:  
 – The order is domestically focused and is unlikely to affect foreign policy or international relations significantly.  
• Social Equity & Progressive Values:  
 – By revoking diversity and inclusion policies, the order restricts progressive efforts to ensure equitable access to national parks, which can indirectly affect nonwhite and marginalized communities across the nation.

6. Policy in Real Life: Individual Impact  
Consider the story of Maria, a second-generation American whose parents immigrated to the United States to seek the promise of equality and opportunity. For years, initiatives that promoted inclusivity in public spaces—like the 2017 diversity and inclusion memorandum—helped ensure that families like hers could enjoy national parks together regardless of their background. With the revocation of these initiatives and the shift toward a strictly American-resident focus, Maria now worries that her extended family, which includes relatives living abroad, might not feel as welcome during joint visits. Though the order promises enhanced infrastructure and restored natural beauty for American citizens, the signal it sends about who belongs can leave lasting impressions on community cohesion and sense of belonging.  

For many U.S. residents, improved facilities and lower costs at national parks could mean more frequent family outings, stronger local economies where park tourism is a major industry, and better-maintained recreational areas. However, the selective nature of these benefits—prioritizing citizens over nonresident visitors—raises questions about fairness and inclusivity, potentially disconnecting parts of America from a shared national heritage that has long been celebrated as unifying.

─────────────────────────────  
7. Final Scoring (-5 to +5 in each category)  

• Fact-Checking Score: +4  
 – The order’s factual assertions about revenue generation and infrastructural improvements are mostly supported by known legislative frameworks like the Great American Outdoors Act.  

• Constitutionality Score: +3  
 – While largely within the President’s statutory authority for managing federal lands, the preferential treatment clauses and broad rule rescissions could invite legal challenges regarding administrative fairness and equal protection for foreign visitors.  

• National Stability Score: 0  
 – The order is unlikely to destabilize national institutions but may contribute to political polarization by reversing inclusivity policies.  

• Harm Score: -1  
 – Economic impacts on tourism and potential exclusion of nonresident families hint at mild harm, especially for communities that benefited from earlier diversity initiatives, though the benefits of improved parks counterbalance some concerns.  

• Progressive Values Score: -2  
 – By rescinding diversity and inclusion efforts and privileging domestic access, the order undermines progressive priorities that seek broad, equitable access to public spaces, even though it does not affect core areas like healthcare, education, childcare, or housing.  

Aggregate Score Calculation: +4 +3 +0 -1 -2 = +4  
 → Interpretation: A Neutral or Unclear Impact overall.

8. Action & Mobilization  

✉️ Letter to Congress:  
Dear [Representative’s Name],

I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the recent executive order that directs our national parks to favor American residents by imposing higher entry fees on foreign visitors and rescinding policies that promoted diversity and inclusion. While enhancing park infrastructure is a welcome objective, the selective approach risks undermining the inclusive and equitable access that has long enriched our public spaces. Such measures have broader implications for how we demonstrate fairness and respect for all communities, including those who have long benefited from efforts to make public lands accessible to everyone regardless of background.

I urge you to oppose this directive and advocate for policies that sustain and expand access to our national treasures for every individual. Ensuring that our parks remain symbols of unity and shared heritage is critical—not only for our cultural identity but also for maintaining the trust and engagement of communities across the country. Please support legislative measures that reinforce inclusive public policies and protect the progressive values of fairness and opportunity.

Sincerely,  
[Sender’s Name]

─────────────────────────────  
9. Final Verdict & Takeaways  
The executive order is narrowly tailored to alter national park management—raising fees for nonresident visitors and using new revenue to improve park infrastructure while aiming to make parks more affordable for U.S. citizens. Although the physical improvements and increased domestic visitation could be seen as beneficial, the rollback of diversity and inclusion policies raises significant concerns about equity and fairness. This action may exacerbate social divisions and be perceived as undermining efforts to make public spaces accessible to all Americans, particularly marginalized communities.

Key risks include potential legal challenges over equal protection and administrative overreach, along with political backlash from communities that see the removal of inclusion measures as a step backward. While the order is legally defensible within the President’s land management authority, its politically charged provisions call for increased vigilance and advocacy to protect inclusive public policy. For progressive constituencies, mobilization through direct outreach to Congress and social media is essential to ensure that public access to national parks—with all their historical and cultural significance—remains universally accessible.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Assessment:  
Aggregate Score: +4 (Neutral or Unclear Impact)  

While the executive order may improve certain operational aspects of our national parks for American residents, its exclusionary aspects—such as rescinding diversity measures—undermine progressive values. Advocacy is needed to ensure that future policies uphold the spirit of inclusivity that has long enriched our nation’s shared public spaces.
