This executive order issued by President Donald Trump aims to adjust tariffs on automotive parts and components from Mexico previously imposed by Executive Order 14194.

**Key Provisions:**
- Articles entered free of duty as goods from Mexico per various sections of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) will not be subject to the additional ad valorem duty rate set by Executive Order 14194.
- The rate of duty on potash not covered in the above exemption is reduced from 25% to 10%.
- These adjustments are effective from March 7, 2025.

This order modifies the tariffs imposed on Mexican automotive imports under Executive Order 14194, reducing economic strains on the U.S. automotive sector.
